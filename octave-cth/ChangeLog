	to make it easier to add in new types in the future.
	* inst/cluster_with_types.m: major refactoring to make it easier to add new
	types.

2018-10-23  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/cthinfo.m: ditto.
	* inst/cthinfo.m: ditto.
	* inst/concat_types.m: fix bug, arc should have been arch. How did the
	swallow stuff *ever* work?

2018-09-24  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/period2str.m: change swallow and lareflx control strings to be
	CONTROL, because that is what it really is.

2018-09-21  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/drawbar.m: make the font just a bit larger. Can barely read it on
	some monitors.

2018-09-20  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/period2str.m: add in support for lareflex.
	* inst/drawbar.m: ditto.

2018-09-19  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/export_db.m: Fix conceptual error. Assumed that the seq# for
	                    all of the cth names were 1-N. When clustering and
							  exporting a subset of a .cth file, this is not true,
							  can be 100, 103, 334, 400, 1001, etc.
	* inst/cth_project.m: add in archetype param to export_db call.
	* configure.ac: bump up to 1.3.9.

2018-08-20  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/cth_project.m: Add option to not filter out flats so they can be
	included in clustering. This is mainly to avoid throwing away sparse CTHs,
	which always wind up in the flats CTH set.
	* configure.ac: bump up to 1.3.8

2018-07-26  dale@health.usf.edu

	* debian/control: discover during release libcurl3 is gone, need libcurl4

2018-07-20  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/ctlstim_clust.m: remove restriction that we do not do ctl/swallow
	because there was a time when there never was ctl/swallow, just swallow.
	* src/dijkstra.cpp: octave has changed, int * is now long int * for a
	couple of vars.
	* configure.ac: bump to 1.3.7

2018-05-16  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/cth_project.m: add process ID to window title so concurrent runs do
	not hijack output windows (uses window title to find window id).
	* configure.ac: bump up to 1.3.6.

2018-04-27  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/cthinfo.m: the odd is ctl, even is stim no longer works. swallow ctl
	is 10 and swall stim is 11.
	* configure.ac: bump up to 1.3.5.

2018-03-23  dale@health.usf.edu

	* debian/rules: during pkg release, discover octave-pkg.mk has moved.

	* inst/export_db.m: sense when archetypes are being clustered.

2018-03-09  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/init_consts.m: Add more colors. It breaks the bstem program when
	colors wrap around, because it thinks color == cluster. Adding the second
	swallow archetype runs out of colors.

	* inst/export_clust.m: mods for swallow cth types.
	* inst/findpair.m: ditto.

	* debian/postinst.template: Move old tar file to /lab/SOURCES/old.

2017-07-28  dale@health.usf.edu

	in it as part of creating the package.

2017-07-27  dale@health.usf.edu

	* configure.ac: bump up to 1.3.3.

2017-07-24  dale@health.usf.edu

	of stim.

	After a couple of info requests, the screen gets very cluttered.

2017-05-10  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/period2str.m: Add in cough ctl/stem types.

2017-04-27  dale@health.usf.edu

	clobber the sequence by reserving a range of type numbers for i, lrm, and e
	classes.

2017-04-24  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/findsibs.m: Handle case where the exported CTH is an archetype. They
	don't have siblings.

2017-04-17  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/plot_wins.m: refactor into plot_wins, win_pixels, and cascademon1.
	Need more than 2 kinds of window positioning, tiling and cascading.

2017-04-03  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/cth_project.m: Move calcs for # of cth plot wins to later in flow,
	so we always know # of clusters for every method of entry.
	* inst/period2str.m: deal with case where .type files have no period.

2017-03-31  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/plot_wins.m: This may actually be correct in dealing with toolbars
	and menubars.

2017-03-29  dale@health.usf.edu

	* DESCRIPTION: Bump up to 1.2.9 for release.

2017-03-27  dale@health.usf.edu

	towards center of screen.

2017-03-23  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/plot_wins.m: add in additional params and calcs so we can tile the
	monitors with up to 8 x 8 windows. Makes it a lot easier to compare CTH
	means.
	* configure.ac: bump to 1.2.9.

2017-02-22  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/plot_wins.m: New function to adapt to different monitor sizes based

	* inst/tilemon2d1.m: adjust to use plot_wins.
	* inst/tilemon2d2.m: adjust to use plot_wins.

2017-02-21  dale@health.usf.edu

	execute once even if it is.

	paths through the code.

	windows wind up on top.

2017-01-19  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/cth_project.m: add in scrn_cap flag to alter how some windows are
	displayed for screen captures. Scrolling fixes, sorta, but you can still
	close cth windows and really mess things up.

2017-01-18  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/scroll_plots.m: fix crash bug if user closes plot window. Display
	still kind of messed up, but does not crash.

2017-01-17  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/cth_classify.m: fix bug, was using cluster # instead of distance for
	first cth. Only noticable when there is only 1 cth in the cluster and the
	center and the cth are the same.

	* configure.ac: 1.2.8 released.

2017-01-09  dale@health.usf.edu

2016-08-02  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/win_consts.m: redo this so it get real info about the real size of plot
	windows.  It is amazingly hard to figure out what the window manager/X11
	are doing when the windows are drawn.

	subset of a larger collection of points.

2016-04-22  dale@health.usf.edu

	* DESCRIPTION: update the version, forgot I have to do this in two places.
	* configure.ac: bump to 1.2.4 to pick up the above fix.

	limit.

	Don't check for max, just underflow.

2016-01-15  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/cth_project.m: fix bug in terminal mode, calling wrong cthinfo
	function.  Change default on isomaps to No
	* configure.ac: bump up to 1.2.1

	latter is the correct term.  Octave 4.x also changed the original file name.

2015-08-24  dale@health.usf.edu

	* debian/control: remove octave:Depends, no longer supported, it is enough
	to just depend on ocatve, and it will (they say) take care of the rest.

2015-08-04  dale@health.usf.edu

	* inst/dijkstra.m: rename the .mex file so lookfor will not crashing trying
	to read in the .mex file.

2015-07-30  dale@health.usf.edu
